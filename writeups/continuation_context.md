# Continuation Context

## Scripts and Purposes
- `generate_test_logs.py` — Generates deterministic test log files in .eval and .json formats (70 files total). Run with `python generate_test_logs.py --output-dir test_logs`.
- `benchmark_baseline.py` — Benchmarks original Python log reading performance.
- `benchmark_comparison.py` — Benchmarks original vs Rust-accelerated side by side. Run with `python benchmark_comparison.py`.
- `plot_benchmark.py` — Generates benchmark comparison plots (from prior phase).
- `plot_benchmark_bypass.py` — Generates bypass-phase benchmark plots from `results/benchmark_bypass_final.jsonl`.
- `inspect_fast_loader/src/lib.rs` — Rust extension: JSON parser (NaN/Inf safe), read_eval_file (ZIP with rayon parallel parsing), read_json_file.
- `inspect_fast_loader/python/inspect_fast_loader/_patch.py` — Monkey-patching: replaces 4 inspect functions. Uses Rust for .eval full reads, .json full reads, and batch headers. Falls back for header-only and IO[bytes].
- `inspect_fast_loader/python/inspect_fast_loader/_construct.py` — Fast EvalSample construction bypassing Pydantic model_validate. Recursively constructs all nested Pydantic model types.
- `inspect_fast_loader/tests/test_correctness.py` — 51 correctness tests comparing fields between original and fast implementations.
- `inspect_fast_loader/tests/test_bypass_correctness.py` — 24 bypass-specific correctness tests (model_dump comparison, type checks, edge cases).

Build Rust extension: `cd inspect_fast_loader && RUSTUP_HOME=$HOME/.rustup CARGO_HOME=$HOME/.cargo PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:../.venv/bin:$PATH maturin develop --release`

Note: `RUSTUP_HOME` must be set explicitly for maturin to find rustc.

## Learned Context
- PyO3 v0.23 API: `bool.into_pyobject()` returns a `Borrowed<PyBool>` — need `.to_owned().into_any().unbind()` to convert to `PyObject`.
- `EvalLogInfo` is in `inspect_ai.log._file`, NOT in `inspect_ai.log._log`.
- The cancelled log test: inspect returns `samples=None` for cancelled .json logs but `samples=[]` for cancelled .eval logs.
- **Upstream bug**: inspect_ai's `_read_header_streaming` crashes on error/cancelled .json logs when `results=null`.
- `model_construct()` is unsuitable for bypass: calls `model_post_init` which generates random UUIDs for ChatMessage.id; also slow when fields are missing.
- Direct `__dict__` assignment (`_fast_construct`) is the fastest approach for constructing Pydantic models without validation.
- Event type imports must be at module level (not lazy per-call): 6x faster for 4000+ events.
- `ToolCall` is a `@pydantic_dataclass` (not BaseModel) — needs direct constructor call, not `_fast_construct`.
- `JsonChange.from_` has field alias `from` — must be handled in alias mapping.
- Event timestamps are `UtcDatetime` (AwareDatetime) — serializer expects datetime objects, not strings.

## Current State
Phase `pydantic_bypass_optimization` is complete. .eval full reads achieve 7.25x speedup for 1000 samples, exceeding the 5x+ target. .json full reads achieve 2.64x speedup. All 117 tests pass (79 prior + 38 bypass-specific).
