# Continuation Context

## Scripts and Purposes
- `generate_test_logs.py` — Generates deterministic test log files in .eval and .json formats (~70 files). Run with `python generate_test_logs.py --output-dir test_logs`.
- `benchmark_comprehensive.py` — In-process benchmark of ALL operations. Can be unreliable for some measurements due to caching artifacts.
- `benchmark_fresh_process.py` — **Primary benchmark**: runs each measurement in isolated subprocesses for reliable numbers. Use this for final reported speedups.
- `plot_comprehensive.py` — Generates all comprehensive benchmark plots from latest results.
- `plot_fresh_process.py` — Generates fresh-process benchmark plots (speedup + absolute times).
- `inspect_fast_loader/src/lib.rs` — Rust extension: JSON parser (NaN/Inf safe), read_eval_file, read_eval_headers_batch (rayon parallel), read_eval_sample, read_eval_summaries, read_json_file.
- `inspect_fast_loader/python/inspect_fast_loader/_patch.py` — Monkey-patching: replaces 9 inspect functions. Uses Rust for .eval operations, falls back for header-only and IO[bytes].
- `inspect_fast_loader/python/inspect_fast_loader/_construct.py` — Fast EvalSample construction bypassing Pydantic model_validate. **Fragile**: hard-codes inspect_ai model types. See docstring for update instructions.
- `inspect_fast_loader/tests/helpers.py` — Shared test utilities (deep_compare, assert_logs_equal).
- `inspect_fast_loader/tests/test_correctness.py` — Correctness tests comparing original vs fast implementations.
- `inspect_fast_loader/tests/test_bypass_correctness.py` — Bypass-specific correctness tests.
- `inspect_fast_loader/tests/test_new_patches.py` — Tests for single sample, summaries, streaming, batch headers.
- `inspect_fast_loader/tests/test_edge_cases.py` — Edge case tests (corrupted ZIPs, missing entries, NaN/Inf, large logs, etc).

Build Rust extension: `cd inspect_fast_loader && RUSTUP_HOME=$HOME/.rustup CARGO_HOME=$HOME/.cargo PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:../.venv/bin:$PATH maturin develop --release`

Note: `RUSTUP_HOME` must be set explicitly for maturin to find rustc.

## Learned Context
- `model_construct()` is unsuitable for bypass: calls `model_post_init` which generates random UUIDs for ChatMessage.id. Direct `__dict__` assignment (`_fast_construct`) is the correct approach.
- `ToolCall` is a `@pydantic_dataclass` (not BaseModel) — needs direct constructor call, not `_fast_construct`.
- `JsonChange.from_` has field alias `from` — must be handled in alias mapping.
- Event timestamps are `UtcDatetime` (AwareDatetime) — serializer expects datetime objects, not strings.
- **EvalSampleSummary has a model_validator (thin_data)**: Can't bypass with _fast_construct.
- **Upstream bug**: inspect_ai's `_read_header_streaming` crashes on error/cancelled .json logs when `results=null`.
- **In-process benchmarks can be unreliable**: Use `benchmark_fresh_process.py` for reliable numbers.
- **Batch header scaling drops with large-header files**: A 5000-sample log's header.json takes ~31ms to read. This dominates batch reads including that file.

## Current State
All phases complete. 177 tests pass, 0 skipped, 0 failed. 9 functions patched. All performance targets met.

Tested against inspect_ai version 0.3.188. The `__init__.py` warns on version mismatch.

## Phase-specific write-ups
- `writeups/write_up_code_cleanup_and_review.md` — Code cleanup and final review phase
- `writeups/write_up_optimization_features_polish.md` — Batch header optimization, new patches, benchmarks
- `writeups/write_up_pydantic_bypass_optimization.md` — Bypass optimization write-up
- `writeups/write_up_core_rust_implementation.md` — Core implementation write-up
- `writeups/write_up_documentation_scaffold_setup.md` — Initial phase write-up
- `writeups/write_up.md` — Overall project write-up (key takeaways only)
